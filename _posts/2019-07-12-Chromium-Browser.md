Chrome is the most popular browser in the world, but there would be no Chrome without Chromium.
Chromium is an free and open source web browser developed by Google which is the base of many web browser like Opera, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Amazon Silk among others. It is also widely used by many third party companies to make their own web browsers.
Chrome browser which is not open sourced derives most of its code from Chromium browser. Chrome is feature-rich and has automatic updates which is different from Chromium which doesn't come as a stable release.
Chromium is rough, and not just around the edges. In practical terms, the latest version of the Chromium browser will be far buggier, much more prone to crashes, than even the rawest version of Chrome. Google says so, in fact. "It may be tremendously buggy," warns the Chromium download page. But Chromium is more secure since it does not send crash reports or usage data to Google.
On the other hand, the information Chrome can collect ranges from where users click to the device's operating system.ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

Chromium Project also announced its Chromium OS open source Project which includes the code base, user interface experiments and some initial designs for ongoing development. Chrome OS is all about the web. The entire experience takes place within the browser and there are no conventional desktop applications. This means users do not have to deal with installing, managing and updating programs. It is highly secure because every time one restarts the computer the operating system verifies the integrity of its code. If one's system has been compromised, it is designed to fix itself with a reboot.
"It is an operating system for people who spend most of their time on the web."-Google Blog.
