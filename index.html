									<h2><a href="#">So what actually CodeZoned is?</a></h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
									<p>CodeZoned is an open source organisation building software to make a difference in the lives of students and developers.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
								We are a group of open source contributors working on projects related to various domains of computer science. Some of our on going projects include PyDataStructs, a python package for data structures; BNN, a lite weight deep learning framework with a specialisation aimed for binarized neural networks; adaboost, a C++ implementation of adaboost algorithm with GPU support in CUDA; reinforce, which aims to be a package for reinforcement learning algorithms and researchers would be able to use its APIs for writing their own algorithms.
=======
									<p>For us computer science is less of a subject and more of a girlfriend or boyfriend, depends ;-) We learn AI, ML, DL, CP, and obviously the underlying mathematics.<br/>
									Uh! we were too busy with CS that we didn't have the time to edit the pic below. Make a PR if you have a better one.<br>(Umm.. Looks like someone already did. But we are always open to PRs.)</p>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/main_page.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>
                <p>So let's give you a complete overview. We basically are a group of people on <a href="https://gitter.im/codezoned2017/Lobby">gitter</a> and whatsapp and there we share, a lot of tech doubts, some useful resources for learning.
									We firmly believe in open sourcing stuff. Till now we have a huge collection of resources from a lot of contributors, licensed under the MIT license.
								</p>
                <p>As you can see in the navbar, we have a blog, known as TechInfo, where you can write your own thoughts about tech. Check it out and get some idea. To add your blog entry, just make a PR to the website's repo.
									It will be up as soon as it is merged.

								We also participate in various open source programs and work with budding contributors exposing them to software development pipeline for writing quality code. We have participated as a mentoring organisation in KWoC, GSSoC and similar other programs so far.
