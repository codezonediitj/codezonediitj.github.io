I have 255 friends on facebook yet I am alone .I speak to all of them regulary still none of them really know me.The problem I encounter is in the spaces between looking into their post or at a name on a screen.I looked around and then realised that this media we call social is anything but when we open our computers , smart phones we get engulfed and it’s our doors we shut .All this technology we have is just an illusion of community, companionship yet when one step away from this device of delusion one awaken to see a world of confusion. A world where we're slaves to the technology we mastered , where our information gets sold by some rich greedy people. A world of self-interest, self-image, self-promotion,where we share all our best binary but leave out the emotions.We are at our most happy with an experience we share but is it the same if no one is there . Be there for you friends and they’ll be there too but no one will be there if a group message will do.We edit and exaggerate, crave adulation and pretend in a manner that we don’t notice the social isolation.We put our words into order until our lives are glistening and we don’t even know if anyone is listening. Being alone isn’t the problem, let me just emphasize that if you read a book, paint a picture, or do some exercise,you are being productive, and present, not reserved or recluse.You’re being awake and attentive and putting your time to good use. So when you’re in public and you start to feel alone just put your hands behind your head and step away from the phone.You don’t need to stare at your menu or at your contact list just talk to one another and learn to co-exist.I can’t stand to hear the silence of a busy commuter train when no one wants to talk through the fear of looking insane.We’re becoming unsocial & it no longer satisfiesto engage with one another and look into someone’s eyes.We’re surrounded by children who since they were born watch us living like nerds and crooked and think it’s the normal. It’s not very likely you will make world’s greatest dad if you cannot entertain a child without a using an iPad.When I was a child, I would never be home,I’d be out with my friends on our bicycles, we would roam.We’d build our own sandhouse, deep in the ground .Now the parks are so quiet and it gives me a chill to see no children outdoor and the swings hanging still.There’s no skipping or hide-seek, no marbles and no steeple.We’re a generation of idiots, smart phones and dumb people. So look up from your phone, shut down that useless display,take in your surroundings and make the most of today.Just one real connection is all it can take,to show you the difference that being there can be made. Be there in the moment when she gives you the look that you remember forever as when love overtook.The time you first hold her hand or first kiss her lips,the time you first disagree, but still love her to bits.The time you don’t need to tell hundreds about what you’ve just done because you want to share the moment with just this one person.The time you sell your computer so that you can buy ring for the dream girl who is now the real thing.The time you want to start a family and the moment when you first hold your baby girl and get to fall in love again.The time she keeps you up at night and all you want is rest and the time you wipe away the tears as your baby flees the nest.The time your little girl returns with a boy for you to hold and the day he calls you granddad and makes you feel real old The time you take in all you’ve made, just by giving life attention and how you're glad you didn’t waste it by looking down at some addictive invention.The time you hold your wife’s hand, and sit down beside her bed you tell her that you love her and lay a kiss upon her head.She then whispers to you quietly as her heart gives a final beat that she’s lucky she got stopped by that lost boy in the street.But none of these times ever happened, you never had any of this.When you’re too busy looking down. You don’t see the chances you miss. So look up from your phone, shut down those useless displays.We have a finite existence.Why to waste all our time getting caught in the net,as when the end comes nothing’s worse than regret.I am guilty too of being part of this machine,this digital world, where we are heard but not seen.Where we type and don’t talk, where we read as we chat and where we spend hours together, without making eye contact.Don’t give in to a life where you follow the hype,give people your love, don’t give them your like.Disconnect from the need to be heard and defined .Go out into the world and leave distractions behind.Look up from your phone and shut down that display,stop reading this article, live life the real way.
