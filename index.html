									<h2><a href="#">So what actually CodeZoned is?</a></h2>
									<p>For us computer science is less of a subject and more of a girlfriend or boyfriend, depends ;-) We learn AI, ML, DL, CP, and obviously the underlying mathematics.<br/>
									Uh! we were too busy with CS that we didn't have the time to edit the pic below. Make a PR if you have a better one.</p>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/pic01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>
                <p>So let's give you a complete overview. We basically are a group of people on <a href="https://gitter.im/codezoned2017/Lobby">gitter</a> and whatsapp and there we share, a lot of tech doubts, some useful resources for learning.
									We firmly believe in open sourcing stuff. Till now we have a huge collection of resources from a lot of contributors, licensed under the MIT license.
								</p>
                <p>As you can see in the navbar, we have a blog, known as TechInfo, where you can write your own thoughts about tech. Check it out and get some idea. To add your blog entry, just make a PR to the website's repo.
									It will be up as soon as it is merged.
								</p>
								<p>
									We also promote online tech events for free. Just scroll down a little bit and send us a message. :-) We don't have the money so only 50 requests per month will be accepted. :-(
									Learn, share and explore. See you soon!!
								 </p>
