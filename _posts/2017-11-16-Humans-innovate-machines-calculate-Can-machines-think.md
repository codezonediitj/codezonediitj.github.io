CodeZoned’s TechInfo is back with one of the most debatable topics, “Humans innovate, machines calculate-Can machines think?”. Well, whenever we are given a problem, for instance, take a CodeZoned’s puzzle, then our innovative human mind, through the help of pre-acquired knowledge, begins to create a solution to that puzzle. However, the big question is, can machines ever do the same. Can machines ever generate innovative algorithmic solutions to problems in a way that we create? Though the question has no specific answer and we are presenting here, our point of view on the topic.

Well, we all know the basic purpose of machines in the beginning was just to calculate. The method of calculation was provided by us and machines were not able to do that on their own. However, today, the technology has reached to a level that at this stage we can think of making machines that can handle a completely new situation by themselves. But wait! The main problem lies here. When humans face a completely new situation then our brain can create innovative solutions to tackle those situations but machines can’t because they still work on the same principle, that is calculation. Say, a machine and a human being are giving the well-known, JEE Advanced. Now, every time, it appears with a completely new pattern that is unknown to both the human and the machine. However, human mind will be able to tackle the situation very effectively. However, the machine is likely to fail, because there will be no algorithm stored in it to tackle that pattern. Again, it is clear that machines can calculate much faster than humans but the innovative power is with us only. For a machine it is necessary to be programmed for new situations. Even for handling completely new situations we have to programme it with an algorithm that can handle that case.

Hence, it is clear that, Humans innovate and machines just calculate. Feel free to present your views in the comments section.
