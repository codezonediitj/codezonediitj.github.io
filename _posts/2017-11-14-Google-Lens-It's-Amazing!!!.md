WiFi, the most needed thing among us. Here comes the Google Lens which can help you directly connect to the WiFi source that has been scanned. Yes, you read that right. It sounds amazing. Just point your camera to anything, and Google Lens will let you know what it is. This feature was announced by Google during Google I/O 2017 on 4th October, 2017. Let's see how it works and what makes it so amazing.

Google Lens is mainly based on AI and data analysis. It is way ahead of Google Image Search, though the basic principle is quite similar. Unlike Google Goggles, which was released in 2011, Google lens has the extra capability of not only identifying things but also understanding it and connecting it to the data that Google posses. For instance, Google Lens can easily pull out email addresses from flyer ads. Not only this, it can also identify albums, movies & books just based on their cover art. What can be more amazing than that.

Adding more to it, this feature will be installed on Google's new phone, Pixel 2.
I'm quite sure that you would be quite surprised after reading this post. Well, technology has many more surprises undisclosed for us.
