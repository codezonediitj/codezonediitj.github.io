Perhaps a decade ago, a scientist was a gray-haired man in a white labcoat and an engineer, was man in a yellow hard-hat drawing up plans in a large piece of chart paper. But today, the perception has irrevocably shifted towards a more romantic description of scientists, and if a part of it was due to Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, the biggest contribution is on part of Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

Born Anthony Edward Stark, son of successful business Howard Stark, he is a young prodigy who enters into MIT at the age of 15. After the death of his parents, he inherited the Stark Industries at a very young age and managed to take it to greater heights due to innovative mind.

But at the same time, he was also known as a maverick, an irresolute playboy who spent his carousing all over the world. But his mindset undergoes a profound transformation when he is kidnapped by a terrorist organisation in Afghanistan, where he faces the ground realities of the world for the first time. He builds a powered armour from the tools given to him by the terrorists to build a missile, and plans to escape with his fellow captive Dr. Ho Yinsen. But Yinsen is killed during his escape, which makes Stark vow to eliminate all terrorist from the world.

Back in USA, he takes to crime-fighting and stops the weapons manufacturing arm of Stark Industries in a bid to reduce the red on his ledger. Quelling betrayal of close aides and external attacks, he also suffers from radiation poisoning, when his self-created arc reactor that he had affixed in his chest starts poisoning him. Despite all, he continues fighting for what he believes is right and keeps innovating his way out of any trouble he may encounter.

Tony Stark, presents an interesting blend of all things fun with the seriousness that is seen as an inherent part of a man of science. His witticisms, and genius intellect, present a potent combination that is perhaps close to a perfect presentation of a 'cool' scientist.
